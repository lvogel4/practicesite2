<h1> About Me </h1> <br>

<p class = "aboutme"> In terms of information about me, I would say that I'm currently a <b> college student at GMU. </b> I'm a transfer student previously from <b> NOVA (Northern Virginia Community College); </b> it's safe to say that my transfer was a bit complicated.
Basically, I started off at the NOVA in Manassas, partially at the advice of my LiveJournal friends (and yes, LiveJournal <i> used </i> to be cool), and I think they definitely helped me make the right decision. Even though Manassas NOVA didn't work
out as well as I thought, I did learn that NOVA in general was a good way to get a head start. </p>

<p class ="aside"> Community college is a good alternative to traditional colleges -- it's especially helpful for those who are more comfortable attending private schools. While public school is cheaper,
private school is good for neurodivergent people if only to help them fit in easier. I know that I started out at public school for my elementary school, but at the advice of my parents,
switched over to private school for middle school. More specifically, my school was a Montessori school, and I think it worked out surprisingly well in terms of how my school experience went
by and large. </p>

<p class = "aside2"> I ended up completing my General Studies degree at Loudoun NOVA, where I participated at <a href = "https://www.collegesteps.org/"> College Steps. </a> I can safely say College Steps was one of my most productive experiences, especially given that I am
<b> neurodivergent </b> and the peer mentors and teachers alike did a good job in terms of making me feel welcome. </p>

<p class = "GMU"> I am at George Mason University, currently. I am a year away from graduating and getting my Bachelor's Degree, which I am proud of. </p>

<aside>

<p class = "Graduation"> In terms of my graduation, I would have graduated earlier if not for a genuinely horrific class that made me have to repeat the idea of math,
Groundhog Day-style. I should say that it is fortunate that I got out when I did and transferred to CollegeSteps. I highly recommend <a href = "https://www.collegesteps.org/"> CollegeSteps </a>
as a good college alternative for people on the autistic spectrum. </p>

<h2 class = "Skillstuff"> Skills and Experiences </h2> <br>

<p class = "skillsandexperiences"> If one was to ask what one of my greatest strengths is, I would say it is my writing ability and my verbal ability. From the age of four, I was writing -- rather childish stories, what you'd expect from a four year old, but
it's still prominent. In addition, I have become skilled at video editing, art, photography, and critical analysis (albeit critical analysis I've done in my free time). Math has never been one of my strong suits, but I think thanks
to a particularly good teacher at College Steps, I became good at it. I am also good at picking up on new skills quickly. </p>

<p class = "skillsandexperiences2"> In terms of my experiences, I unfortunately have not had many writing-related internships or volunteer jobs. I have, however, had volunteer experience before, namely volunteering at the organization Earth Sangha in order to help out with plants and taking care of them.
In addition, I currently volunteer at a library where my job typically involves finding missing books as well as doing the occasional mark-outs (in other words, marking which books can't be used by the library anymore), folding papers, and more. I would say that it is a quite
rewarding experience, especially given my supportive boss and co-workers, as well as having the opportunity to be around books. (Always a plus!) </p>

<h2 class = "More"> More About Me </h2> <br>

<p class = "career">In terms of the career I've been looking for, it mostly involves one day becoming a writer. A published author, more specifically. From the beginning, I have always been fascinated with works of fiction that I've loved and have a desire to create my own. I have currently been into fanfiction since I was eleven years old (at the suggestion
of my eye doctor, apparently, who had a daughter around my age into the very medium), but I have a desire to branch out into original fiction for myself. My influences have been media such as Star Wars; I hope one day to create a space opera that people will appreciate. <br>
