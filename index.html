<h3> Introductions </h3> <br>
</br>

<p style = "intro"> Hello, everyone! My name is <b> Lauren Vogel. </b> I am <b> twenty-seven, </b> about to turn <b> twenty-eight </b> in <b> July, </b> and am a student at <b> George Mason University. </b>
I am currently working towards my <b> English degree </b> and hope one day to become a <b> published author. </b> <br>
</br>
</p>

<h3> Interests and degrees </h3> <br>
</br>

My current passions include <b> fanfiction, </b> specifically <b> Star Wars </b> although I occasionally <b> branch out into other fandoms. </b> I have been practicing fanfiction <b> since I was eleven years old </b> when my eye doctor, of all people,
recommended it to me thanks to his daughter being into fanfiction. (Thank you, Doctor!) 

<aside> I believe that fanfiction is a valid form of storytelling, and can even dodge around issues that original fiction unfortunately can get hobbled by, such as
the executives meddling in things. </aside>

My degree I'm aspiring to is <b> a Bachelor's Degree. </b> Avenue Q might have asked once what you do with a B.A. in English, but I'll find a way. <br>
